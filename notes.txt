What does 'Agile' mean?
 - framework for continuous dev rather than linear
 - working to produce small deliverable pieces of code at end of sprint
 - a sprint is a defined period of time agree goals
 - terms used in 'Agile':
  - backlogs: product and sprint
  - scrum master makes sure on-task and help resolve - a SUPPORTING role
 - scope creep - taking on far too much
